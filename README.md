# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Purpose
To build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Description  
The starter code provided is the backend portion of an E-Commerce website. I used Express.js for the server and MySQL for the database along with Sequelize to run SQL models and queries. The SQL database includes tables for products, categories, tags, and product tags. API routes were used to make requests and updates from the database which are joined through Sequelize queries.


## Challenges and Successes
Lately I have been overwhelmed with the amount of files that we are given for one assignment. For this assignment I tried to get an understanding of what each file meant, why it was needed and how I might use it. This will help long term with starting projects from scratch. I continue to work through the Readme one line at a time until completion as well searching for documentation that helps me get a better understanding.

## Technologies Used  
Express.js  
Node.js  
MySQL  
Sequelize
