# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Purpose
To build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Description


## Challenges and Successes
Lately I have been overwhelmed with the amount of files that we are given for one assignment. For this assignment I tried to get an understanding of what each file meant, why it was needed and how it is used. This should help long term with starting projects from scratch. I continue to work through the Readme one line at a time until completion as well searching for documentation that helps me get a better understanding.

## Technologies Used  
Express.js
